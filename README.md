House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project aims to predict house prices using linear regression, a fundamental technique in machine learning. By analyzing various features of houses such as size, number of bedrooms, location, and others, the model predicts the price of a house.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about houses including their size, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location, and price. It was collected from various real estate sources and curated for this project.

Usage
Data Preparation: Ensure the dataset is preprocessed and cleaned. This may involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Training: Train the linear regression model using the prepared dataset.
Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict house prices for new data.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
